# DraconisEngine
A custom engine built during college.

This code is not meant to run since it has dependencies not included here. It is simply a showcase of what I have done during college. Everything within this repository is code that I have built, written, and debugged myself.

The only things handed to us were a few OpenGL resources, everything else we had to build ourselves. We also had to do one self-lead project, which for me was the particle emitter, building on what I learned before.

This code was written in Winter and Spring of 2024
